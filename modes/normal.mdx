# Normal Mode

Normal mode is the default mode in Helix and is where most text manipulation and navigation commands are performed. This mode emphasizes keeping your hands on the home row for efficient editing.

## Overview

In Normal mode, each keystroke is interpreted as a command rather than inserting text. This allows for quick navigation and manipulation of text without moving your hands from the main typing position.

## Common Operations

- Navigation using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for left, down, up, and right respectively
- Text manipulation commands (delete, yank, change)
- Selection commands
- Window and view management
- File operations

## Key Bindings

Here are some essential Normal mode commands:

### Navigation
