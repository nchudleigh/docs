title: Hallucinations and Silence Removal
---

## What's the issue?

If you are noticing hallucinations or repetition at the end of your transcription, this is likely due to long periods of silence in your recorded audio.

## How to Fix it

To fix this, we are going to enable the Silence Removal feature. 

First open the "Configuration" tab on the left. 

Then enable "Advanced Settings." This will show you some new options. 

Scroll down and enable the "Silence removal" option.

This should help with the hallucinations and repetition.
