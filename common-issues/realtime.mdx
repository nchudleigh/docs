title: Realtime Unavailable 
---

## What's the issue?

The reason Realtime is grayed out is because it is only supported but the Nova (Cloud) Voice model.

## How to Fix it

To enable Nova (Cloud), open Superwhisper settings and navigate to Modes/Voice model/Model and pick Nova (Cloud) from the drop down.


You can then enable the Realtime feature via the slider.
