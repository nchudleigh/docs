title: Unable to Create Modes 
---

## What's the issue?

Sometimes when enabling ICloud Documents syncing, the Superwhisper folder moves to ICloud, but Superwhisper still thinks its in documents.

This causes Superwhisper to not be able to do things like create modes. 

## How to Fix it

To fix this, we are going simply reselect documents as the folder location. 

First open the "Configuration" tab on the left. 

Then enable "Advanced Settings." This will show you some new options. 

Scroll down and Click the "change folder" option. 

Navigate to your Documents folder and click "open".

Now all you need to do is click "confirm" and you should be good to go!
