title: Hallucinations and Silence Removal
---

## What's the issue?

Some times when there is silence inbetween words spoken, the AI can "hallucinate" words into your transcription. 

## How to Fix it

To fix this, we are going to enable the Silence Removal feature. 

To do this, first open the "Configuration" tab on the left. 

Then enable "Advanced Settings." This will show you some new options. 

Scroll down and enable the "Silence removal" option.

This should remove the AI hallucinations.

Hope this page helped solve your issue. Cheers.
