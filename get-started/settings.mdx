title: How to Open Settings
---
There are two ways to open settings.

## Method 1

Up in your toolbar near the wifi symbol, there should be a Superwhisper Logo.

When you click on it, a list of options should appear. 

Go down to settings and click to open. Just like that, settings should be open!

controls
width="100%"
height="auto"
/>

## Method 2

When you have the SuperWhisper dictation window open, click on the window and press the âŒ˜ and , keys to open settings.

This should then open the settings window!

/>

Hope this helped and have a great day!
