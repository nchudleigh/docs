Alright! You should be all set to use SuperWhisper on your iOS device.

## Did the QR Code Fail?

If the QR code failed don't worry there is an easy fix! 

Go back to where you opened the QR code on your Mac and double click your key. It should say "Copied you clipboard".

Now just paste your key on the end of this link:
```
superwhisper://license/
```
you should get something like this: 
```
superwhisper://license/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Now all you need to do is open that link on your iOS device.

Hope this helped solve your issue!
